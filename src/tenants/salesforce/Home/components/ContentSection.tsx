              From the Andes to the Outback, from mangroves to Giant redwood
              groves, life on Earth hangs in the balance. Salesforce is doing
              everything we can to counter climate change and create a
              sustainable, low-carbon future for all. That means reducing
              emissions, as well as protecting and improving carbon sinks like
              forests and oceans — the lungs of the Earth.

            <h3>We save trees, trees save us.</h3>
            <p>
              Trees purify our air, cool our planet, prevent soil erosion, and
              add grace and beauty to our homes and communities. Without trees,
              life as we know it will cease to exist. However, since the dawn of
              civilization, nearly half the world’s forests have been cleared or
              degraded. And we continue to lose 10 billion trees per year. Of
              the original 6 trillion trees that once covered the earth’s
              landmass, only 3 trillion remain.

              sustainability program and integrating climate action into the
              core of our business to ultimately deliver on this shared,
